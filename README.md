## Firmware for zigbee sniffers
Firmware for various sniffers like:
- CC2531 USB sniffer
- [Placeholder] CC2530 with either PCB antenna OR external antenna
- [Placeholder] CC2530 with CC2591 RF frontend and external antenna
- [Placeholder] CC2530 with RFX2401 RF frontend and external antenna

There are two types of firmware: [coordinator](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Supported-sniffer-devices#zigbee-coordinator) and [router](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Supported-sniffer-devices#zigbee-router)

This repository is complementary for [Zigbee2MQTT](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt).

## Flashing
For more details on how to flash firmware on your device please check [Getting started](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Getting-started) or [Alternative flashing](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Alternative-firmware-flashing-methods).

## Testing
There might be from time to time testing firmware. Please check [branches](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt-firmware/branches) to see if there is anything in progress.
